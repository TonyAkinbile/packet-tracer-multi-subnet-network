# packet-tracer-multi-subnet-network
Cisco Packet Tracer project demonstrating VLSM subnetting, inter VLAN routing, DHCP relay, and wireless network integration.

For a detailed explanation of the network design, subnetting decisions, and routing strategy, see the [Network Overview](docs/network-overview.md).
